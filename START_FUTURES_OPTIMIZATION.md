## âœ… FINAL RECOMMENDATION

### Should You Do This?

**ABSOLUTELY YES!**

Your forex strategies are PROVEN (80% win rate, 187% returns).

But futures are DIFFERENT (different liquidity, sessions, patterns).

**2-3 weeks testing = much higher confidence and success rate!**

Plus, you'll discover futures-specific edges that could make your win rate even HIGHER!
