## 🔄 HOW ADAPTATION WORKS

### **All-Weather Strategy Example:**

```
Monday 9 AM: Market opens
├─ Detect regime: TRENDING (ADX 28)
├─ Load trending parameters:
│  ├─ Signal strength: 0.54 (easier)
│  ├─ Volume: 2.1x (relaxed)
│  └─ Expected WR: 72%
├─ Generate signals with trending params
└─ Trade if conditions met

Tuesday 10 AM: Market changes
├─ Detect regime: VOLATILE (ATR spike)
├─ Load volatile parameters:
│  ├─ Signal strength: 0.69 (stricter!)
│  ├─ Volume: 3.25x (higher)
│  └─ Expected WR: 68%
├─ Adjust risk immediately
└─ More selective entries

Wednesday News Event: CPI Report
├─ 2 hours before: Reduce positions
├─ During release: Flat (no trades)
├─ 30 minutes after: Resume trading
├─ Detect new regime post-news
└─ Adapt parameters accordingly
```

**Adaptation happens AUTOMATICALLY every 1-2 hours!**

## 🔄 LEARNING EXAMPLES

### **Scenario 1: Week 1 Below Target**

**Problem:** Week 1 actual return: 2.1% (target was 3.8%)

**Learning Process:**
```
Daily Review:
- Which days underperformed? (Mon, Wed)
- Which regimes? (Ranging markets both days)
- Which strategy underperformed? (75% WR Champion)

Analysis:
- Ranging markets dominated Week 1
- 75% WR Champion doesn't adapt to ranging
- All-Weather and Ultra Strict V2 did OK

Actions for Week 2:
- Increase allocation to adaptive strategies (All-Weather, Ultra Strict V2)
- Reduce allocation to 75% WR Champion
- If ranging continues, tighten parameters for All-Weather
- Target: Catch up deficit in Week 2 (aim for 5.5% instead of 3.8%)
```

### **Scenario 2: News Event Impact**

**Event:** CPI Release (Week 2, Oct 10)

**Learning Process:**
```
Pre-Event (2 hours before):
- Reduce positions to 50%
- Set tighter stops
- All-Weather switches to VOLATILE regime

During Event:
- Flat (no trading)
- Monitor volatility

Post-Event (30 minutes after):
- Check regime: Still VOLATILE
- ATR 2.1x average
- All-Weather uses volatile parameters (0.69 signal strength)
- Very selective entries only

Learning:
- Document CPI impact on each pair
- EUR_USD moved 50 pips, USD_JPY 40 pips
- Trending regime emerged after 2 hours
- All-Weather switched to TRENDING parameters
- Captured trending move with appropriate settings

Outcome: +$180 on CPI day
```
