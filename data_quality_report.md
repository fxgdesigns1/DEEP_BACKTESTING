# Data Quality Report for Trading Simulations

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the historical market data in your deep backtesting project, I've identified several critical issues that could significantly impact the accuracy of your trading simulations. The data has both strengths and weaknesses that need to be addressed before running simulations.

## Data Structure Overview

- **Total Currency Pairs**: 10 major forex pairs + commodities
- **Timeframe**: 1-hour candlestick data
- **Date Range**: March 2023 - August 2025 (approximately 2.4 years)
- **Data Format**: OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)

## Data Quality Issues Identified

### 1. **Critical Issue: Weekend Gaps**
- **Problem**: Regular 49-hour gaps every weekend (Friday 21:00 to Sunday 22:00)
- **Impact**: This is normal for forex markets, but needs proper handling in simulations
- **Frequency**: 128 gaps in EUR/USD, 128 in USD/JPY, 654 in XAU/USD

### 2. **Data Inconsistency Between Sources**
- **Prices Directory**: Contains 15,001 rows per currency pair
- **Individual Directories**: Contain 17,281+ rows per currency pair
- **File Size Differences**: Individual files are ~2x larger than prices/ files
- **Date Range**: Individual files start from October 2022 (earlier than prices/)

### 3. **Volume Data Problems**
- **Prices Directory**: Contains realistic volume data (95-59,067 for EUR/USD)
- **Individual Directories**: All volume values are 0 (invalid for market simulation)

### 4. **Data Completeness**
- **Expected Hours**: 21,142 hours (March 2023 - August 2025)
- **Actual Data**: 14,999 hours
- **Missing Data**: 6,143 hours (29% missing)

## Market Condition Accuracy Assessment

### ✅ **Strengths**
1. **Price Data Integrity**: No negative prices, no OHLC violations
2. **Realistic Price Movements**: 
   - EUR/USD: Max hourly change 1.23%, average 0.06%
   - USD/JPY: Max hourly change 2.11%, average 0.08%
   - XAU/USD: Max hourly change 2.21%, average 0.12%
3. **Proper Timezone Handling**: UTC timestamps with proper formatting
4. **Market Hours**: Correctly reflects 24/5 forex trading with weekend gaps

### ❌ **Critical Weaknesses**
1. **Incomplete Data Coverage**: 29% of expected data points are missing
2. **Volume Data Inconsistency**: Zero volumes in individual files make them unusable
3. **Data Source Confusion**: Two different datasets with different characteristics
4. **Missing Market Events**: Large gaps could miss important market movements

## Recommendations for Accurate Simulations

### **Immediate Actions Required**

1. **Use Prices Directory Data Only**
   - The `data/historical/prices/` directory contains the correct, volume-validated data
   - Individual currency directories have zero volume and should be ignored

2. **Handle Weekend Gaps Properly**
   - Implement gap-filling logic for weekends
   - Use Friday close prices for weekend gaps
   - Consider using 5-minute data for more granular analysis

3. **Data Completeness Check**
   - Investigate why 29% of data is missing
   - Consider data source reliability
   - Implement data validation before simulation runs

### **Simulation Configuration**

1. **Time Period Selection**
   - Start simulations from March 2023 (when data becomes consistent)
   - End simulations at August 2025 (current data limit)
   - Avoid periods with large data gaps

2. **Risk Management**
   - Account for missing data periods in position sizing
   - Implement gap risk controls
   - Use conservative leverage given data quality issues

3. **Validation Requirements**
   - Run data quality checks before each simulation
   - Validate OHLC relationships
   - Check for data continuity

## Data Quality Score: 6.5/10

### **Breakdown:**
- **Price Accuracy**: 9/10 (No OHLC violations)
- **Volume Quality**: 8/10 (Prices directory has realistic volumes)
- **Data Completeness**: 4/10 (29% missing data)
- **Time Continuity**: 7/10 (Weekend gaps are normal, but other gaps exist)
- **Data Consistency**: 5/10 (Two different datasets with different characteristics)

## Conclusion

While your data has good price integrity and realistic market movements, the significant data gaps and inconsistencies pose serious risks to simulation accuracy. The 29% missing data could lead to:

- **Incomplete backtesting results**
- **Missed market events affecting strategy performance**
- **Inaccurate risk calculations**
- **Unrealistic profit/loss projections**

**Recommendation**: Address data quality issues before running trading simulations. Use only the `prices/` directory data, implement proper gap handling, and consider sourcing more complete historical data for critical periods.

## Next Steps

1. **Data Source Investigation**: Determine why 29% of data is missing
2. **Gap Analysis**: Identify and categorize all data gaps
3. **Simulation Planning**: Design simulations that account for data limitations
4. **Data Enhancement**: Consider supplementing with additional data sources
5. **Validation Framework**: Implement automated data quality checks
